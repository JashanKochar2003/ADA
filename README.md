# AIM - Analysis and Design of 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm

## 0/1 Knapsack

The 0/1 Knapsack algorithm is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to maximize the value of items selected for a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. Each item has a weight and a value associated with it, and the knapsack has a maximum weight capacity. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to efficiently solve the problem by constructing a 2D table where rows represent the items and columns represent the weight capacity of the knapsack. By iteratively filling in the table, the algorithm computes the maximum value that can be achieved for different combinations of items and knapsack capacities.

### Algorithm

The algorithm typically involves two main steps:

1. **Merge-Purge**: This step merges two lists of pairs into a single list while purging redundant entries.
   
2. **Set Maker**: This step generates sets of pairs based on the current item's weight and profit, ensuring that the weight of the combination does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.

```cpp
vector<pair<int,int>> mergePurge(vector<pair<int,int>> v1, vector<pair<int,int>> v2) {
    // Implementation of merge-purge step
}

vector<pair<int,int>> setMaker(vector<pair<int,int>> s, vector<vector<pair<int,int>>>& s2, int profitList[], int weightList[], int i, int maxW) {
    // Implementation of set maker step
}
```

## Source Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<pair<int,int>> mergePurge(vector<pair<int,int>> v1 , vector<pair<int,int>> v2) {
    // Implementation of merge-purge step
}

vector<pair<int,int>> setMaker(vector<pair<int,int>> s, vector<vector<pair<int,int>>>& s2, int profitList[], int weightList[], int i, int maxW) {
    // Implementation of set maker step
}

int main() {
    vector<pair<int,int>> v2;
    vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> s;
    vector<vector<pair<int,int>>> s2;
    v2.push_back(make_pair(0,0));
    s.push_back(v2);
    int weightList[] = {5,3,4,6};
    int profitList[] = {10,30,45,70};
    int maxW = 10;
    for(int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        setMaker(s[i - 1], s2, profitList, weightList, i - 1, maxW);
        s.push_back(mergePurge(s[i - 1], s2[i - 1]));
        for(int j = 0; j < s[i].size(); j++) {
            cout << s[i][j].first << "," << s[i][j].second << "\t";
        }
        cout << endl;
    } 
    return 0;
}
```

## Usage

1. **Compile the Source Code**: Compile the provided source code using a C++ compiler.

2. **Run the Executable**: Run the compiled executable to perform the 0/1 knapsack algorithm.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the results of the knapsack algorithm to the console.

## Conclusion
