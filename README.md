**README: Analysis and Design of N-Queens Algorithm**

### AIM
The aim of this project is to implement and analyze the N-Queens algorithm. Given a chessboard of size \( n \times n \), the N-Queens algorithm finds all possible configurations of placing \( n \) queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other.

### Algorithm
The N-Queens algorithm follows these steps:
1. Define a function `place` to check if it's safe to place a queen in a particular position on the board.
2. Define a function `nQueens` to recursively place queens on the board.
3. Iterate through each column of the board and try to place a queen in each row.
4. If a queen can be safely placed in a position, recursively call `nQueens` to place the remaining queens.
5. Print all valid configurations of queen placements.

### Source Code
The provided source code (`NQueens.cpp`) implements the N-Queens algorithm using C++. It takes the number of queens \( n \) as input and finds all possible configurations of placing \( n \) queens on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.

### Execution and Output
1. The program prompts the user to enter the number of queens to be placed.
2. It finds and prints all possible configurations of placing the specified number of queens on the chessboard.
3. Each output line represents a valid configuration where the numbers represent the column positions of the queens in each row.

### Conclusion
- The N-Queens algorithm efficiently finds all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.
- It uses backtracking to explore all possible configurations and prunes branches that lead to invalid solutions.
- The algorithm's time complexity depends on the size of the chessboard and the number of solutions, making it suitable for small to moderate-sized problems.

Feel free to explore the source code and experiment with different values of \( n \). If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know!
