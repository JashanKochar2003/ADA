# AIM - Analysis and Design of Graph Coloring Algorithm

## Graph Coloring

The Graph Coloring algorithm aims to find all possible combinations where two connected vertices don't have the same color allotted. It assigns colors to vertices of a graph in a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

### Algorithm

The algorithm employs backtracking to assign colors to vertices while ensuring that adjacent vertices have different colors.

1. **Next Color**: Determines the next available color for a vertex, ensuring that it doesn't conflict with the colors of its adjacent vertices.

2. **M Color**: Recursively assigns colors to vertices starting from the first vertex, ensuring that all vertices are colored with the minimum number of colors possible.

```cpp
class GraphColor {
    // Implementation of the Graph Coloring algorithm
};
```

## Source Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class GraphColor {
    int n, m, colors;
    vector<vector<int>> G;
    vector<int> x;

public:
    // Constructor and member functions definition
};

int main() {
    // Input graph details and create GraphColor object
    return 0;
}
```

## Usage

1. **Compile the Source Code**: Compile the provided source code using a C++ compiler.

2. **Run the Executable**: Run the compiled executable to perform graph coloring.

3. **Input**: Provide the number of vertices, edges, and available colors as input.

4. **Output**: The program outputs all possible combinations of vertex-color assignments.

## Conclusion

The Graph Coloring algorithm efficiently assigns colors to the vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices have different colors.
