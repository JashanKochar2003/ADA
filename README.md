**README: Analysis and Design of Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm**

### AIM
The aim of this project is to implement and analyze Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm, a method for multiplying two matrices using divide and conquer technique.

### Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
Strassen's algorithm divides the matrices into submatrices and computes the product recursively, reducing the number of multiplications needed compared to the conventional method.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Divide each matrix into four equal-sized submatrices.
2. Compute 10 intermediate products using recursive calls.
3. Combine these products to obtain the final result.

### Source Code
The provided C++ source code (`strassonsMultiplication.cpp`) implements Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm. It includes functions for matrix addition, subtraction, and Strassen's multiplication.

### Execution and Output
1. The program defines two matrices `A` and `B`.
2. It prints the matrices `A` and `B`.
3. It computes the product of matrices `A` and `B` using Strassen's algorithm.
4. Finally, it prints the result matrix.

### Conclusion
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication algorithm offers a more efficient way to multiply matrices compared to the conventional method.
- It reduces the number of scalar multiplications required, thus improving performance for large matrices.
- The algorithm's time complexity is \(O(n^{log_2 7})\), which is better than the conventional method's \(O(n^3)\) for large \(n\).
- Strassen's algorithm is widely used in practice, especially for large-scale matrix computations.
