**README: Analysis and Design of Assembly Line Algorithm**

### Aim
The objective of this project is to implement and analyze the Assembly Line Algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the most efficient way to traverse two assembly lines, considering different paths and costs between them.

### Algorithm
The Assembly Line Algorithm follows these steps:
1. Initialize two arrays `f1` and `f2` to store the minimum cost of reaching each station on each assembly line.
2. Iterate through each station and calculate the minimum cost of reaching it from the previous station on the same line or from the other line, considering the transfer time between lines.
3. Determine the minimum cost of reaching the end station from either assembly line.
4. Backtrack through the stations to determine the optimal path.

### Source Code
The provided source code (`assembly_line.cpp`) implements the Assembly Line Algorithm using C++. It utilizes a `graph` class to represent the assembly line graphs and performs operations such as adding edges and computing the minimum cost.

### Execution and Output
1. The program prompts the user to enter the costs of starting and ending points for both assembly lines, along with the costs for changing paths between assembly lines.
2. It then prompts the user to enter the number of nodes and edges for the assembly line graphs and whether they are directed or undirected.
3. The program generates the assembly line graphs based on user input and computes the minimum cost of traversing the assembly lines.
4. It outputs the minimum cost and the optimal path through the assembly lines.

### Conclusion
- The Assembly Line Algorithm efficiently determines the most cost-effective way to traverse two assembly lines, considering different paths and transfer times.
- It reduces the overall production cost by optimizing the assembly line traversal process.
- The algorithm's time complexity depends on the number of stations and edges in the assembly line graphs, making it suitable for real-world assembly line scheduling problems.
