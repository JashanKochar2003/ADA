**README: Analysis and Design of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm**

### Aim
The aim of this project is to implement and analyze the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Given two strings, the LCS algorithm finds the length of the longest subsequence that is common to both strings.

### Algorithm
The LCS algorithm follows these steps:
1. Initialize a 2D array `c` to store the length of the LCS for each pair of prefixes of the input strings.
2. Initialize another 2D array `b` to store the directions needed to reconstruct the LCS.
3. Iterate through the input strings to populate the `c` and `b` arrays, considering three cases: when the characters match, when they don't match but there's an LCS by deleting from the first string, and when there's an LCS by deleting from the second string.
4. Backtrack through the `b` array to reconstruct the LCS.
5. Return the length of the LCS.

### Source Code
The provided source code (`LCS.cpp`) implements the LCS algorithm using C++. It takes two strings as input, converts them into vectors of characters, and computes the LCS length.

### Execution and Output
1. The program prompts the user to enter two strings.
2. It converts the strings into vectors of characters and calculates the LCS length using the LCS algorithm.
3. It outputs the length of the LCS and the common subsequence.

### Conclusion
- The LCS algorithm efficiently finds the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings.
- It has applications in various fields such as bioinformatics, data comparison, and version control systems.
- The algorithm's time complexity depends on the lengths of the input strings, making it suitable for processing large datasets efficiently.

Feel free to explore the source code and experiment with different input strings. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know!
